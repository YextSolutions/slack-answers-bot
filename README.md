# Repo Description

This is an example repository for a Slack app made using Yext Search. The Slack app uses the [Yext Answers API](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/liveapis/answersapi/) in order to provide answers to user's questions. Users in Slack can ask questions to the app via the / operation and receive answers in a modal. They also can ask questions via the @ mention action and receive answers in a thread in any channel.

# How to Use

You can adapt this code to your needs based on the search experience you make using Yext. You can choose a custom name for your app and customize it based on the verticals you have to make it your own for your Slack organization.
